# rock-paper-scissors
The aim of this project is to build a simulator of the rock-paper-scissors game using the computer as opponent.
The game has 5 rounds and the player who wins more rounds will be the winner. 
We've faced some challenges like assigning a random choice to the computer, asking to the player their choice and creating the functions and the logic that will allow us to play the 5 rounds and define a winner.
